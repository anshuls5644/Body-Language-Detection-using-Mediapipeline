# Body Language Detection

This project implements a real-time body language detection system using Python, Mediapipe, and OpenCV. It can detect facial expressions, hand gestures, and body posture by leveraging Mediapipe's holistic body tracking capabilities. The system is designed for tasks like emotion recognition, human-computer interaction, and gesture analysis.

## Features

- **Real-Time Processing**: Live video capture and processing for body language detection.
- **Facial Landmarks**: Detects and visualizes key points on the face.
- **Hand Gestures**: Identifies hand landmarks and tracks gestures.
- **Body Posture**: Captures and visualizes key points of the body.
- **Customizable Visualization**: Configurable overlays for detected landmarks.

## Technologies Used

- **Mediapipe**: For efficient detection of body, hand, and facial landmarks.
- **OpenCV**: For video feed handling and frame-by-frame processing.
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing detection logic and visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install mediapipe opencv-python pandas scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the notebook `Body-Language-Detection.ipynb`.
2. Run the cells sequentially to initialize the system.
3. The live video feed will open, displaying detected landmarks in real time.
4. Press `q` to exit the video feed.

## Project Workflow

1. **Input Processing**: Captures live video feed using OpenCV.
2. **Landmark Detection**: Mediapipe processes each frame to detect facial, hand, and body landmarks.
3. **Visualization**: Detected landmarks are drawn on the video feed for real-time feedback.

## Future Enhancements

- **Emotion Recognition**: Integrate advanced models to classify emotions using facial expressions and body posture.
- **Gesture Commands**: Implement a gesture-based control system for applications.
- **Performance Optimization**: Improve detection speed and accuracy for better real-time performance.
